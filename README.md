# threadpool
A thread pool is a design pattern in Java that provides a pool of reusable threads for executing tasks. The basic idea behind a thread pool is to create a group of worker threads that are waiting for tasks to be assigned to them. When a new task arrives, one of the idle threads in the pool is assigned the task, and the thread executes the task. Once the task is completed, the thread is returned to the pool and is available for another task.

The thread pool design pattern is useful in scenarios where the application needs to execute a large number of tasks, and creating a new thread for each task is inefficient. Instead, a fixed number of threads are created in the pool, and tasks are assigned to them as needed. This reduces the overhead of thread creation and improves performance.

the thread pool design pattern is a powerful technique for managing a large number of tasks efficiently, and it can be used in a wide range of applications, such as web servers, database servers, and other multi-threaded applications.
